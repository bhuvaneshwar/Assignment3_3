1)List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail.

	The major components of Hadoop are:

		* YARN

		* HDFS

		* Mapreduce

	* YARN :

		- It is Yet Another Resource Negotiator.

		- Yarn is mainly used for very large applications for big data processing.

		- It is considered as the heart of Hadoop 2.X

		_ YARN mainly provides resource management and gives data governance tools for hadoop.

		- It acts as a central platform and provides security.

		- It is used for writing data access applications that executes on hadoop

		- Advantanges:

			* Less expensive.

			* Linear scale storage. 


	*HDFS : 

		- HDFS splits the huge amount of data and stores them in several data nodes at a time perfoming 
		  parallel processing.

		- Components of hdfs: 

			* Namenode

			* Secondary name node

			* Datanode

		- Namenode: It stores the meta dats as fs image and edit logs.

			    It is the master node.

			    If it goes down entire system goes down.

		- Secondary namenode : 
			    It helps to recover in case of  name node failures.

			    It automatically updates to the namenode about the edits.

		- Datanode : 
			    These are the slave nodes.

			    The data nodes are divided into several blocks of each 64 mb.

			    The actual conents are stored here in data nodes.

			    It periodically sends signal to the name node about the data transmissions.


	* Map Reduce : 

		- It distributes data across several machines for processing and called as 
		  batch processing model.

		- Major components are :
		
			*Job Tracker
			*Task Tracker

		* Job Tracker : 

			- It assigns the mapreduce task to the task tracker.

			- It also maintains the status of the task tracker.

			- Overall execution of map reduce is controlled by job tracker. 

		* Task Tracker :

			- It executes the task assigned to it by job tracker.

			- It runs the individual map-reduce tasks on data node.

			- it communicates with job tracker periodically.
